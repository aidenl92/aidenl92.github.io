            <h3>Website Overview</h3>
            <p class="p-margin">The goal of the client’s personal website is to provide disc golf information to new players as well as
                possibly create some interest for potential players. The content of the site will be geared towards
                newer disc golf players, sometimes specifically ones visiting or living in the Charlotte area.
                The content of the site will be categorized as informative and entertainment.</p>

                <li>Home Page</li>
                <ul>
                   <li>The home page of the site will include a brief introduction of the client, disc golf, and why
                       users of the site should be interested in picking up disc golf. We are planning on implementing
                       an “image of the day” which cycles through a set of images every 24 hours. There will be a
                       navigation bar present on all pages for users to easily navigate through the site.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Discs & Gear</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The discs & gear page will detail on the client’s recommendations of discs for new players. He
                        will also provide information on other items that should be brought disc golfing (such as a disc
                        bag, towel, chalk bag, etc.). We are planning on having pictures of the items be linked to
                        external sites where users can conveniently purchase these items (if we are allowed to do this).
                        This page will likely contain dropdown menus.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Charlotte area course reviews</li>
                <ul>
                   <li>The course reviews page will consist of reviews and difficulty ratings for courses in the
                       Charlotte area which the client has played. These reviews will detail the opinions of the overall
                       quality of the course, as well as difficulty ratings and recommendations for beginners. We plan
                       on implementing an image gallery with each course for users to view on the selected course. This
                       is the only page where the intended audience is geared specifically towards new players or
                       potential players of the Charlotte area.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Disc Golf tips</li>
                <ul>
                   <li>This page will contain information on disc golf tips and techniques for new players. We plan on
                       including descriptions, images, and videos of these techniques. Videos will be embedded on the
                       page.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Disc Golf pro quiz</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This page is the only one of the site which is less informative and more for entertainment
                        purposes. We plan on having users fill out a questionnaire of general questions (not private or
                        personal information) and the page will then return a disc golf professional based on the input,
                        as well as a short summary of the disc golf pro. This is essentially one of those generic
                        “which X are you?” quizzes.  These forms will require data validation.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h5 class="const-heading">Dynamic Functionality</h5>
            <p class="p-margin">As of now, there are a few functions that plan to be implemented with JavaScript.  The cycling “image of
                the day” on the homepage will have to load an image from a set and replace it with a different image
                every 24 hours. Only one image should be loaded onto the site at a time. The image galleries which users
                can scroll through on the course review page will also be implemented with JavaScript. The “disc golf
                pro quiz” will also implement JavaScript as a way to return the disc golf pro and their summary based
                upon the users’ answers to the questions.</p>
