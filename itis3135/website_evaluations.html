            <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
            <br>
            <h3><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a></h3>
            <p class="p-margin">Most of us are familiar with Microsoft as the company produces a wide variety of products: software,
                PCs, Xbox, and various consumer electronics. As expected, their website's design meets the CRAP
                principles.</p>
            <ul class="p-margin">
                <li>Contrast: The text is very easy to read against its background. The color choice is also appropriate
                    as there is not any clutter.</li>
                <li>Repetition: The headings, text sizes, and layout is consistent across the page. The color scheme
                    is also mostly consistent across all of the element backgrounds with the exception of things they
                    really want to draw attention to (eg. Xbox game pass).</li>
                <li>Alignment: The titles, headings, and elements are all well aligned, giving the page an organized
                    feel.</li>
                <li>Proximity: The proximity of text to the images make it obvious to the
                    user of which text blocks are connected to which image.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3><a href="http://www2.pnwx.com/">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a></h3>
            <p class="p-margin">This company sells x-ray and radiology equipment. While this isn't a widely known company, their
                website is still very poorly designed and does not adhere to any of the CRAP principles.</p>
            <ul class="p-margin">
                <li>Contrast: The contrast choice is terrible as the black text is difficult to read against the dark blue
                    parts of the background.</li>
                <li>Repetition: While navigating the site, one can almost immediately notice the many inconsistencies in the
                    layouts of pages that should be very similar. This makes it difficult to quickly identify
                    elements of the site.</li>
                <li>Alignment: The images seem like they are aligned randomly, even making the text out of alignment
                    due to the way the text is wrapped around the images. This gives the site a messy, unorganized
                    appearance.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Elements that are related have very poor proximity to each other on
                    this site. There are even several instances where there are huge line breaks between
                    text that is in the same paragraph element.</li>
            </ul>
