		"description":"Generally, back hands will finish left (if throwing with the right hand) and forehands will
                       finish right. Use this to throw the proper shot depending on the shape of the hole."

		"title":"Improving Your Drive",
		"description":"When throwing your first shot (aka drive), it’s important to not aim directly down the fairway,
                       but aim for a target in the sky that is appropriate for the shot you’re throwing. For example,
                       if you’re throwing a backhand drive, imagine a target up in the sky a little to the right and above
                       where you want to land, your disc will fade into the appropriate spot."

	{
		"title":"Sinking That Putt",
		"description":"When putting, aim for a single chain link. It’s easier to aim for a smaller target, that way
                       if you miss you have a higher chance of getting into the basket. If you aim generally for the
                       basket, it’s easier to miss off of it."

	{
		"title":"Know Your Discs",
		"description":"Understand the differences between putters, drivers and midranges and what
                       their appropriate distances are. You can generally throw midranges/fairway drives for most holes -
                       but if you have the speed capabilities to control a driver, they can provide very good distance."

	{
		"title":"Keep the Discs Dry",
		"description":"Always carry a towel. Toweling off your discs allow more uniform release, limiting slip or extra
                       grip that you’re not expecting - negatively impacting your throws."
