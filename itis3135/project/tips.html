            <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
            <p>
                Being a beginner at disc golf can seem very intimidating, but luckily there are some easy tips and
                tricks to get more consistent shots:
            </p>
           <div id="accordion">
               <h3>Backhand or Forehand?</h3>
               <div>
                   <p>
                       Generally, back hands will finish left (if throwing with the right hand) and forehands will
                       finish right. Use this to throw the proper shot depending on the shape of the hole.
                   </p>
               </div>
               <h3>Improving Your Drive</h3>
               <div>
                   <p>
                       When throwing your first shot (aka drive), it’s important to not aim directly down the fairway,
                       but aim for a target in the sky that is appropriate for the shot you’re throwing. For example,
                       if you’re throwing a backhand drive, imagine a target up in the sky a little to the right and above
                       where you want to land, your disc will fade into the appropriate spot.
                   </p>
               </div>
               <h3>Sinking That Putt</h3>
               <div>
                   <p>
                       When putting, aim for a single chain link. It’s easier to aim for a smaller target, that way
                       if you miss you have a higher chance of getting into the basket. If you aim generally for the
                       basket, it’s easier to miss off of it.
                   </p>
               </div>
               <h3>Know Your Discs</h3>
               <div>
                   <p>
                       Understand the differences between putters, drivers and midranges and what
                       their appropriate distances are. You can generally throw midranges/fairway drives for most holes -
                       but if you have the speed capabilities to control a driver, they can provide very good distance.
                   </p>
               </div>
               <h3>Keep the Discs Dry</h3>
               <div>
                   <p>
                       Always carry a towel. Toweling off your discs allow more uniform release, limiting slip or extra
                       grip that you’re not expecting - negatively impacting your throws.
                   </p>
