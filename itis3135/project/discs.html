                            A must-have disc for players of all skill levels. Buzzz is a straight flying mid-range disc
                            that is extremely versatile. A player can do well on most courses using only this disc and
                            a putter!

                        <td>
                            Leopard is a great choice for a first driver. It is easy to throw and cover a long
                            distance without a crazy flight path.

                        <td>
                            The Pig is a stable putter that doesn't have much glide. This allows its shots to
                            be predictable, even when throwing against the wind.

                            The Wizard is another overstable putter that is a popular choice among disc golf players.
                            Its consistency makes it versatile for not only putting, but also approaches and
                            short drives.

                        <td>
                            Destroyer is a very fast and stable driver. It is a great disc for getting distance
                            on a forehand throw.
