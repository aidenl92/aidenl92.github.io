                    Recently re-designed, Hornets Nest Park sits in Charlotte. Made popular through it’s tournament on
                    the disc golf pro tour, Hornets Nest holes present a challenging, but fun round of disc golf. With
                    the front nine  early holes being mostly simple shots, it slowly bleeds into more technical and
                    longer holes through the back nine. The water on hole 2 is the detriment to many players, but is
                    still a very realistic shot to hit. Offering long and short tees, Hornets nest is a good park for
                    any range of player skill.
                    Difficulty: Moderate to Hard

                    Renaissance park is home to 3 different course layouts. Renske, which is the shortest of the 3, is a
                    pleasantly easy course that still presents interesting shots. Most of the holes are very short and
                    the rough is relatively forgiving. The low challenge makes this course perfect for new players, and
                    for more experienced players - a great way to have fun with this course is to limit your disc
                    selection (think of it like mini-golf for disc golf!).
                    Difficulty: Beginner

                    Renaissance park’s “Silver” course is on the other side of the park from the Renske course.
                    Completely different holes, the Silver course falls between Renske and Gold in terms of difficulty.
                    Hole one on Silver presents a simple forehand shot or backhand turnover, but as the holes bleed into
                    the woods the shots become much more technical with an unforgiving rough. Not only being able to
                    push distance on some holes is very useful, but also controlling the speed of your disc is a good
                    skill here as well. Renaissance’s Silver course is a great stepping stone away from more beginner
                    and shorter courses.
                    Difficulty: Beginner to Medium
